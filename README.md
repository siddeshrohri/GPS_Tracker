# GPS_Tracking

GPS Data Processing Program
This program allows you to process GPS data generated by a device such as a mobile phone. It includes two classes, Point and Track, which can be used to represent GPS points and tracks, respectively. The program also includes a small application, TrackInfo, that demonstrates the usage of these classes.

Features
The Point class represents a GPS point and includes information such as timestamp, longitude, latitude, and elevation.
The Track class represents a sequence of GPS points and provides methods for adding points, retrieving points, and performing calculations on the track data.
The TrackInfo application allows you to analyze a track by providing information such as the number of points, lowest and highest points, total distance traveled, and average speed.

Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Usage
Compiling and Running Tests
Run the unit tests using the following command:

./gradlew test

This will check if the implemented methods in the Point and Track classes pass the provided tests.

TrackInfo Application
Compile the project and run the TrackInfo application using the following command:

./gradlew run 

The application will display information about the track, including the number of points, lowest and highest points, total distance traveled, and average speed.

Advanced Tasks (Optional)
The program provides additional advanced tasks for extra marks:

Option 1: KML Files: This task involves adding a method to the Track class that writes track data to a KML file, and creating a program (ConvertToKML) to convert a CSV track file to a KML file.

Option 2: Elevation Plot: This task requires implementing a JavaFX application (PlotApplication) that plots elevation as a function of distance along a track.

Please refer to the assignment documentation for detailed instructions on how to complete these advanced tasks.
